# Message Hub

## What is this?
- It literally is a message hub, the goal is to aggregate all messages i will receive through a day, and make it visible from the terminal (coz, you know, i use neovim btw)
- It is also my excuse to learn:
  - The inner workings of websocket
  - How to use websocket
  - How to design a pub sub system, using websocket and go
  - OpenTUI
  - Different language's abstraction over the websocket server
  - (Optional) Deterministic Testing

## What it is not
- It is not production ready, far far far from it
- It is not a general public product, it is design with me as the sole user
