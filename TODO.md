## Websocket processing
- [x] response
- [x] fragmentation handling
- [x] python script to interactively tests websocket

## Websocket
- [x] refactor / decouple web socket logic from the message hub
- [x] register conn, keep track of liveliness, and the type of connection
- [x] context cancelling (graceful shutdown for a connection)
- [x] integrate with message hub

## Testing
- [ ] Closing logic / scenarios
  - [ ] cancel ctx
  - [ ] conn close during read
  - [ ] conn close during send
  - [ ] read deadline exceeds
  - [ ] write deadline exceeds
- [x] protocol violation
- [ ] Setup
- [ ] Auto ping pong
- [x] Text frame / frag frame read
- [x] Text frame / frag frame read 

## The event handling part
- [ ] construct the websocket protocol, with type and action
- [ ] separate client and producer connection
- [ ] allow subscription on events

## Interactive testing
- [ ] a better way to handle server shutdown, so all things can quit gracefully
- [x] add an option to force quit
